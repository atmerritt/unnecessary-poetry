# unnecessary-poetry

An app to create silly, unnecessary poems out of everyday experiences or thoughts.

Credit where credit is due:
* This repo is inspired by and very heavily based upon the [hello-genai](https://github.com/docker/hello-genai) repository
* Helpful resources: [Docker Model Runner announcement](https://www.docker.com/blog/introducing-docker-model-runner/) and [dockerdocs](https://docs.docker.com/model-runner/#integrate-the-docker-model-runner-into-your-software-development-lifecycle)


## Requirements
* macOS
* [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)

## Quick start

```

cd unnecessary-poetry
```

2. Make any necessary changes to the parameters defined in the [`.env`](./.env) file
* `LLM_BASE_URL`: The base URL of the LLM API
